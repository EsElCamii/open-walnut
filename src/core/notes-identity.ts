/**
 * notes-identity.ts — id migration for the notes vault (IMPL-CONTRACT §2 / tech §8.3, §12).
 *
 * Two operations, both reuse the reconciler's guarded byte-preserving back-write
 * and the structural index; neither touches git-sync.ts:
 *
 *  1. stampAllIds()  — the "stamp all ids now" batched migration (§12.3). New notes
 *     get an id at create-time; legacy / git-pulled / AI-written notes get one
 *     lazily on first reconcile. This batches that back-write across the WHOLE
 *     vault in one pass so a user (or boot, for an id-less legacy vault) can reach
 *     full id coverage immediately, instead of file-by-file as each note is touched.
 *
 *  2. mergeDivergentIds() — the earliest-created-wins merge (§8.3 layer 3). When a
 *     git merge across two machines leaves the SAME logical note with TWO ids
 *     (two independent generators raced on an id-less note), the deterministic
 *     tie-break is: earliest `created` wins (then earliest id timestamp). The
 *     reconciler re-points inbound links from the losing id to the winner (an
 *     index UPDATE — links key on id) and rewrites the loser's `id:` line on disk
 *     so both histories converge. Logged + reversible (files stay source of truth).
 *
 * Identity guard (shared with the reconciler, §8.3): every disk write is under
 * `withFileLock(<note>.md)` + a re-read-and-hash-recheck, so a migration pass can
 * never clobber an in-flight edit. A note that changes underneath us is skipped
 * and picked up on the next reconcile.
